    <h1>Do you want to become a Link Crew Leader? <br>Apply Here!</h1>
    <img src="/picutres/events/IMG_17431.jpg">
    <h3>Why should you join Link Crew?</h3>
    <p>I decided to become a Link Crew leader kind of on a whim. Late into my sophomore year, I felt really 
        dejected from everything at school. One night, I was just sitting at my desk watching some show and 
        it all hit me at once.</p>

    <p>I felt like I was wasting my school life. I chose easy classes, and didn't really participate in my clubs. 
        I wasn't failing or anything, I was a decent student, but I was just autopiloting and I realized that was 
        what was causing all the emptiness I felt. Basically, it was a mid-highschool-life crisis.</p>

    <p>I just started throwing myself at opportunities that I would maybe like, but would never actually try for, 
        under normal circumstances. Some time that week, I got recommended to become a Link Crew leader by one of
         my teachers. I eventually convinced myself to apply, and got accepted. (I missed a mandatory meeting but 
         I was mercifully allowed to make it up (Thanks Ms. Vu))</p>
        
    <p>I pretty much felt uncomfortable the entire time I was being trained. But after enough of the training 
        messages were drilled into my head, I started to get into it. And if that wasn't a good enough reason, I 
        now had 18 freshmen that I felt responsible for.</p>


    <h3>My Contributions?</h3>
    <p>So, at the start of junior year, my mid-highschool-life crisis seemed to be clearing up. I really got into 
        it after we started hosting events for the freshmen, and I could actually see other people enjoying their 
        time at an event that I helped put together. For the first time, I felt like what I was doing was making a 
        real impact at school.</p>

    <p>Once that feeling set in, I really began to enjoy Link Crew. I put in my best work towards events that we would
        host. It was a unique experience thinking up an event, promoting it, preparing, and actually hosting the event 
        and seeing people come to them. To me, hosting these events that freshmen seemed to enjoy, I felt like I could 
        make up for the years that I feel were on autopilot.</p>

    <p>I also paid for food a couple of times. Can't forget one of my deepest contributions.</p>

    <h3>Why am I applying again?</h3>
    <p>So, with the story laid out, it looks like it's mission accomplished... I joined Link Crew to get out of the rut
        that I was in, and throughout junior year, I pulled myself out. As my last year approaches, I can actually say 
        that I'm proud of what I've done, so far.</p>

    <p>I'm applying to become one again because I think that I could do way better than last year. I worked hard for 
        events, but I think that I could have connected with my individual freshman more. And at random times, I get 
        ideas for events that we could pull off, or additions to ones that we already do. </p>
    
    <p>I'm applying to learn more lessons. I didn't realize it, but when I was teaching my freshmen, I was also teaching
        myself lessons I should've known a while ago. I feel like this is the best mental state I've been in, in a long
        time. There's things that you can only learn on your own, and Link Crew helped provide those learning 
        experiences.</p>

    <p>My last, slightly less admirable reason, is that I'm joining because I just had a lot of fun last year. 
        Without Link Crew, I would've never been able to have stories like sleeping at the school, going overboard
         at IKEA, late night karaoke, and searching for friends missing on nature trails. This program has taught 
         me so much, and I never feel like I'm just sitting down and working to learn, it's always disguised as just 
         a meeting, or just an event, or just something fun we could do.</p>
