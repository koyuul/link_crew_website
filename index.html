    <h4>Who are we?</h4>
    <p> ACHS Link Crew is a group of juniors and seniors who have volunteered to
      help freshmen make their transition to high school as smooth, and
      memorable as possible! Each freshman is assigned two Link Crew leaders
      who will personally be to make their first year the best it could
      possibly be! </p>

    <p> Link Crew leaders also prepare events for the freshman class, such as
      freshman-only dances, rallies, and themed events like pumpkin carving, and
      gingerbread house building. More info on the events we host can be found
      here. As a club, we focus on three aspects of an academic year, being
      <a href="#">spirit<a>, <a href="#">scholarship<a>, and
      <a href="#">service<a>. Apply now at <a href="#">this link!</a></p>
