    <h2>Spirit</h2>

    <h3>What does the spirit specialty do?</h3>
    
    <p>A huge part of your high school experience comes from school spirit! Link Crew's spirit specialty puts 
    on events for the freshmen class. The spirit specialty puts on events that primarily are freshmen-only, 
    and before major schoolwide events. This is to show freshmen what they can expect for their first high 
    school rallies and dances. Throughout the year, we also host freshmen events such as dodgeball 
    tournaments, game nights, and talent shows.
    <br> <br>
    We also host spirit events in the days approaching most holidays. Examples include pumpkin carving 
    for Halloween, turkey bowling for Thanksgiving, gingerbread house building for Christmas, and more! 
    <br> <br>

        <p>The freshmen rally is one of the biggest events for Link Crew! During this rally, 
          Link Crew puts on games for freshmen, to prepare them for what it'll be like at the
          first schoolwide rally of the year, which usually takes place within a week of the 
          freshman rally. This is also a first for many of the new Link Crew leaders! The rally 
          is the first official event that Link Crew puts on in the school year. After weeks of
          hard work, the rally turned out to be a great success!
