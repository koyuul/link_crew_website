      <h1>What does the spirit specialty do?</h1>
      
      <p>A huge part of your high school experience comes from school spirit! Link Crew's spirit specialty puts 
      on events for the freshmen class. The spirit specialty puts on events that primarily are freshmen-only, 
      and before major schoolwide events. This is to show freshmen what they can expect for their first high 
      school rallies and dances. Throughout the year, we also host freshmen events such as dodgeball 
      tournaments, game nights, and talent shows.
      <br> <br>
      <p>We also host spirit events in the days approaching most holidays. Examples include pumpkin carving 
      for Halloween, turkey bowling for Thanksgiving, gingerbread house building for Christmas, and more! 
      We'd love to hear any ideas that you have for events! Many of these events are thought up by 
      students, for students. Don't hesitate to request events for your class that you'd like to see!
      <a href="#">Submit your ideas here!</a></p>
      <p>Below you can find out about our upcoming and previous events:</p>

            <h3>Freshmen Rally</h3>
            <p>The freshmen rally is one of the biggest events for Link Crew! During this rally, 
              Link Crew puts on games for freshmen, to prepare them for what it'll be like at the
              first schoolwide rally of the year, which usually takes place within a week of the 
              freshman rally. This is also a first for many of the new Link Crew leaders! The rally 
              is the first official event that Link Crew puts on in the school year. After weeks of
              hard work, the rally turned out to be a great success!
