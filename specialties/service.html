    <h2>Service</h2>
    <p>One of the more intimidating aspects of entering high school is the volunteering requirement. 
        However, Link Crew is here to help, and show that getting hours is not only easy but can be 
        a great way to help your community, and meet friends!</p> 
    
    <p>Below are some volunteer opportunites near American Canyon, that are some great ways that you
    can get experience and hours, and build connections with the city!</p>

    <div id="sidebar_div">
        <p>Do you know about a great volunteer opportunity that your classmates might enjoy? Let
            your link crew leader know, or email our service commisioner at: servicecomissioner@nvusd.org
        </p>
